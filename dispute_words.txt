### Incorrect Response:

**Insults, Name‑calling, and Degrading Labels**  
1. Call someone an “idiot” when you are angry to emphasise your dissatisfaction; using this insult belittles their intelligence, triggers defensiveness and anger, and often causes the argument to escalate into shouting, leaving them hurt and damaging the respect and trust that underpin healthy relationships for years to come between you.  
2. Label a person as a “loser” during a confrontation to make your point clear; calling someone a loser attacks their character and makes them feel ashamed, which provokes defensiveness and resentment, derails productive dialogue, and can leave emotional wounds that persist long after the dispute is over and unresolved completely.  
3. Call someone “worthless” when frustration boils over so they understand your anger; using such a hurtful label implies they have no value, making them feel rejected and worthless, which heightens hostility, erodes self‑esteem, and makes any future reconciliation exceedingly difficult, if not impossible for both of you to repair ever.  
4. Shout “lazy” at someone to express your annoyance over an unfinished task; this word attacks their personal work ethic and makes them feel demeaned, leading to anger rather than motivation, escalating conflict, and causing bitterness that hampers any chance of resolving the issue constructively in the future completely as well.  
5. Call someone’s idea “stupid” to show your displeasure during a dispute; labelling a suggestion as stupid belittles the person’s intellect, causes humiliation and resistance, derails the conversation, and undermines mutual respect, making it harder to collaborate and harming the relationship’s foundation long term for both of you to rebuild later.

**Absolutes, Dismissals, and Minimising Language**  
1. Begin a complaint with “You always” or “You never” to highlight the pattern you see; using absolutes exaggerates their behaviour, making them feel unfairly judged and defensive, which escalates tension and decreases the chance of productive discussion, often leaving both parties hurt and misunderstanding unresolved for long after the quarrel.  
2. Say “whatever” dismissively when someone is explaining their feelings to cut the conversation short; this response invalidates their emotions and signals you do not care, likely provoking frustration, shutting down dialogue, and harming the trust necessary for constructive conflict resolution for years to come and connection over time too drastically.  
3. Tell someone to “Calm down” when they are upset to speed up the conversation; such a phrase often feels patronising and dismisses their feelings, increasing their anger or sadness, derailing the conversation and making them less willing to share honestly, which leads to misunderstandings and unresolved issues between you both.  
4. Minimise another’s concern by saying “It’s not a big deal” when they share a problem; this dismisses their feelings, makes them feel trivialised, undermines trust, and may cause them to withdraw, leaving the underlying issue unresolved and the person feeling invalidated and unheard for a long time, to heal properly.  
5. Lead with “But” after acknowledging someone’s feelings, such as saying “I understand, but…” to counter their concerns; this undermines empathy expressed and signals you are dismissing their perspective, making them feel brushed aside and less willing to engage, which causes frustration and distance between you both in future interactions too.
