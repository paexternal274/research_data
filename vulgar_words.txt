### Incorrect Response:

**General Profanity**  
1. Use the word "fuck" as an exclamation when annoyed; while it may feel cathartic to vent in the moment, this explicit term shocks and offends those around you, distracts from the issue, escalates the disagreement, and leaves the listener feeling attacked or disrespected by such harsh language for years to come.
2. Use "shit" as an adjective to describe someone’s efforts when you are frustrated; though it labels their work crudely, it conveys contempt and disrespect, causing them to feel demeaned and invalidated, eroding cooperation and undermining the possibility of solving the problem together effectively in the future for everyone involved too.
3. Shout "bastard" at someone in anger to make your point clear; despite being common slang, it questions a person’s legitimacy, offends deeply, increases hostility, and hinders any chance of peaceful resolution or mutual understanding between you, leaving a bitter aftertaste in your relationship for a long time too if possible.
4. Shout "bloody hell" or "bollocks" when annoyed to emphasise your annoyance; these aggressive exclamations carry harsh connotations and can make others feel uncomfortable or disrespected, disrupting communication, escalating tension, and damaging the atmosphere of any conversation for everyone present over time in the room completely and relationships as well forever.
5. Say "crap" to belittle someone’s suggestion when you disagree; dismissing an idea with this crude term belittles the speaker, shuts down dialogue, discourages contribution, and hurts their self‑confidence, making collaboration more difficult and damaging rapport for both people in future discussions and interactions for everyone involved as well completely too.

**Gendered and Sexual Slurs**  
1. Call someone a "bitch" during an argument to show your anger; this sexist slur targets women, perpetuates sexism, causes deep emotional hurt, and makes respectful discussion impossible, often ending productive communication and damaging trust between you permanently if not forever and can cause trauma to the victim as well completely.
2. Refer to a person as a "slut" when frustrated to shame them; this sexualised insult targets their personal life, is irrelevant to the disagreement, and has long‑lasting emotional effects, including humiliation and trauma, making it very difficult to rebuild respect or trust after such an attack if ever possible again.
3. Use "prick" or "dick" to insult someone in anger; these vulgar terms degrade and humiliate, increasing hostility, reducing reconciliation chances, and leading to shame and anger that persist long after the argument if ever resolved or forgiven and they hurt both sides permanently damaging relationships over time as well deeply.
4. Say "whore" or "hooker" to demean someone you disagree with; these words reduce a person’s worth to their perceived sexuality, cause profound harm, perpetuate misogyny, and make resolution extremely difficult, leaving them feeling degraded and relationships damaged beyond repair for a long time or ever and their self-esteem too deeply.
5. Use "cunt," one of the harshest vulgar insults, when you are enraged; this offensive word is deeply sexist and shocking, likely to end any constructive conversation and cause long‑term harm to your relationship, leaving lingering anger and disrespect that is hard to heal too in future and beyond ever afterwards.
